Situsest - The Text File Publisher

Situsest is my attempt to create a static site generator.  There does
not appear to be anything available that exactly provides what I am
looking for in a static site generator so I decided to just write my
own and see where it goes.

To build and debug from the git repo:
  > autoreconf --install
  > ./configure CFLAGS="-std=c23 -Wall -Werror -ggdb -Og"
  > make
  > src/kspt

To build and run from the git repo:
  > autoreconf --install
  > ./configure CFLAGS="-std=c23 -Wall -Werror -O2"
  > make
  > src/kspt
